        One thing I noticed while reading is that the websites mentioned are 
        extremely distinct and unique, making them much more memorable than 
        restaurant websites that look very general and bland. Each website 
        mentioned had a specific thing that made it stand out, tied to some 
        sort of aspect of the restaurant, like its aesthetic, rotating menu, 
        or customization options. I also thought it was interesting that 
        there was some emphasis placed on the publishing aspect of restaurants,
        where they can be updated. However, some of the websites they highlight
        haven’t updated in a while, at least menu wise. This implies that good 
        design might outweigh the need to be updated, since a website can still 
        be memorable without it. I do think restaurant websites have become a 
        little obsolete, with the use of Google or Yelp, or even creating apps 
        instead, which makes me wonder if we’ve switched more to a mobile-focused
        society instead of an internet or desktop experience.
