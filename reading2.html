        I had never really thought much about why AI generated
        content feels so different from normal human-made 
        content, but I really resonated with this idea of the 
        content feeling like its being made by someone. I'm 
        not sure how to recognize this, besides just feeling it,
        but I can sort of tell if there is actual human intent behind
        the photos in the article. On another note,
        it's interesting the article points out we're expected
        to not care when we're being deceived by AI. When generative AI was
        just beginning to gain popularity, people thought that
        it would mainly be used for harmless stuff, but now we have
        seen it be used all the time for fake photos to spread rumors,
        influence politics, and manipulate people. Especially on
        the internet today, I think we should always be more
        careful in what we are consuming. Art has always been a medium
        where you are meant to do that, and I think that's been lost
        with the constant consumption of content on social media
        or the internet. Introducing more critical thinking of who is 
        making the art and who is it for allows for us to bring back 
        deeper thoughts on art.
