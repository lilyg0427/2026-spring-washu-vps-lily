        I found this idea of the variance of what websites can be very intriging.
        I think in the modern age, as we surf the internet extremely often, we have a very
        strict idea of what websites should be and the way we interact with them. This 
        idea, while useful when keeping the user in mind, has also limited me in my thoughts
        of what a website can be and do. This reading reminds me that building a website can be
        something you come back to update, to grow with and adapt, or to leave for others 
        to find on the internet. I related to the thrown rock metaphor, because I often do 
        leave my projects untouched once I finish them, as I know the more I think about them, 
        the more I obsess over small choices.
