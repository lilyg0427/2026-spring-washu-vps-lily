        When I think of new emergent technology, I tend to think of
        cyborgs, which I think tends to be where it trends these days.
        It's more focused on how we can adapt our bodies and our senses
        to interpret the world around us. However, the thing I think about 
        is how a lot of sci-fi movies or futuristic shows often warn
        about if our soceity turns like: reliant on technology instead of
        trusting our own selves, and our own senses. I think that's why 
        the room model is much more interesting, to me and to the author,
        because we really haven't conceived all the ways we can adjust the environment 
        to help us, rather than adjusting our own selves.
