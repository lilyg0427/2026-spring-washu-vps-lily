        I found Eno's process throughout the documentary particularly interesting. I like
        that he focused on the feeling of the music more than the actual product or what sounds good,
        he was trying to convey a feeling that would be able to go out into the world to do a certain thing.
        I really liked his card oblique strategies, as they really push you to think in a different way than 
        normal when making art. I think a lot of my process is very iterative, where I make a change, decide
        if it works well, and either build on it or get rid of it. However, I think some of the strategies
        he has on the cards really help you to work in a way that comes away from a cause-effect process, and instead 
        focuses on what might be needed at the time or in the future. Another portion of Eno's process I admired
        was the connection with other people. While he was producing, he was obviously working with singers and bands
        to create songs that they liked, but he also took strategies and sounds from other artists, the radio, 
        feelings from nature, and ideas from the world. It made me realize that I perhaps focus a little too much 
        inward when making art, even when I know the project isn't for me, but for the world. I think this is especially 
        helpful in this course, because websites are meant to be explored by others on the web, as the internet 
        was created to be interactive, and to interact with other places and people.
